"Lost Shadow" is a 2D platform game for all audiences where the main character, Enyo, will have to travel a world through a kingdom split into two dimensions: Imeria (light) and Skotos, (darkness) to solve the mysteries surrounding his family.

“Lost Shadow” is structured in the form of levels that the player will have to go through in an imposed order. Completing one level unlocks the next. In the prototype proposed with this report, only the last level is accessible. This corresponds to the level containing the fight with the final boss.

The levels are based on the same overall theme and split into two distinct aspects: a light aspect and a dark aspect. The player, through an artefact acquired at the end of the first level, can in fact change worlds whenever he wants, completely changing the aspect of the level, that is to say the environment, but also the enemies or the physics. 

## Light World
